# Tackling Malnutrition in Africa: A Comprehensive Data Analysis
This project explores the socioeconomic and healthcare factors contributing to malnutrition across 45+ African countries, using data from the World Bank. The study formulates and tests four hypotheses related to food affordability, maternal education, immunization coverage, and GDP, applying statistical analysis and data visualization to derive actionable insights for policymakers.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Analyze and understand key indicators influencing malnutrition in African countries.
- **Data Source:** World Bank's World Development Indicators and Africa Data Indicators.
- **Approach:**
  - Cleaned and prepared raw `.csv` data using **Pandas**
  - Formulated four hypotheses based on public health and economic theory
  - Applied **Pearson** and **Spearman correlation** analysis with p-values to validate relationships
  - Visualized significant trends using **Matplotlib**
  - Drafted policy-oriented recommendations based on findings

## Key Hypotheses Tested
1. **Affordability vs. GDP per capita:** Negative correlation  
2. **Food Prices vs. Malnutrition Index:** Positive correlation  
3. **Immunization Rates vs. Malnutrition:** Negative correlation  
4. **Maternal Education vs. Malnutrition:** Negative correlation  

All hypotheses were supported by statistically significant results, indicating real-world policy relevance.
